# localize-please
#### Automatic localization of your Mac or iOS app using ChatGPT

### What is localize-please?

`localize-please` is a command-line tool that automatically translates the text content of your Mac or iOS app, using ChatGPT. 

Use `localize-please` to translate your app into a new language, or update an existing localization whenever you add a new feature.

Supported file types for automatic localization include:

- .strings (Xcode's standard file type for localizable strings)
- .stringsdict (used by Xcode for handling pluralization cases)
- .xcloc (the file type produced when you export your localizations from Xcode) 
- .txt (Plain text) 
- .md (Markdown)

`localize-please` is incremental (by default), which means it only translates the strings that appear untranslated, saving you time (and money!).

### Requirements

- `localize-please` requires an OpenAI API Key, which you can get for free from [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- OpenAI offers a free quota of API requests for new accounts

### Installation
Download the binary of the latest version of the `localize-please` command line tool from the `Releases` section.

If this tool gains a certain level popularity, we will submit to [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).
### Setup

Run the `set-api-key` command with your OpenAI API key:

```bash
localize-please set-api-key "sk-EXAMPLE-KEY-1234567890"
```

You only need to do this once.

If you want to add a new language to your project, make sure you've done this first using Xcode (Project > Info > Localizations) before running `localize-please`

### Usage

Run the `localize-please` command on a path to your Xcode project folder (that contains .lproj folders):

```bash
localize-please "/Users/zac/Projects/MyCoolApp/"
```
or on a folder contining .xloc files, created by Xcode's `Export Localizationsâ€¦` command

```bash
localize-please "/Users/zac/Desktop/Exported Localizations/"
```

That's it! 

`localize-please` will automatically translate any strings that appear untranslated using ChatGPT.

### Additional options

* `-o, --output-folder <output-folder>`: Specify a folder to save translated files into. Without this set, the original localizable files will be edited in place.
* `-l, --language <ISO 639-1 language code (de, fr, ja, etc)>`: Limit translation to only the specified language. By default all language folders/files detected will be translated).
* `-q, --quiet`: Prevent translations from being printed to the console as the tool runs.
* `-f, --force-translate`: Disables incremental localization. All strings in the project will be sent off for re-translation, even if they already appear translated.
* `--api-key <OpenAI API Key>`: Specify an API key to be used for this particular localization request

### Accuracy & error handling

- ChatGPT is really good at translating. It understands the context that informs an accurate translation.
- ChatGPT may fail to translate a particular string (for various reasons). In this case, the original translation be left untouched. 

#### Should I only rely on this tool for my translations?
Even though ChatGPT does very good translations, it's still worth checking the translation with native speakers. 

Still, it's a lot more time efficient to first translate a project automatically, and then fix the odd issue, than for a human localizer to translate from scratch.

### Performance
- The OpenAI ChatGPT API currently translates about 2 strings/second. Please be patient the first time you run the tool on a new language. 
- `localize-please` is incremental, so further invocations will run more quickly (just strings that need translating).

### Avoiding ambiguity in translations

Some strings can be ambiguous without further clarification. For instance:

```strings
"Empty" = "Empty";
```

It's not clear whether this string is an imperative verb (like "**Empty** the trash!") or an adjective "The folder is **empty**".

To provide a translator (or in this case, ChatGPT) with the required context to deliver an accurate translation, you can add a localizer comment

```strings
/* Empty the trash */
"Empty" = "Empty";
```

If you're using .xcloc files (Xcode's Export Localizations feature), make sure you specify a comment for the localizer when defining your string.

#### General

```swift
   let string = String(localized: "Empty", comment: "Empty the Trash")
```

#### SwiftUI views

```swift
    Text("Empty",
         comment: "Empty the trash")
```

#### Storyboards
Specify the comment under in the "Localizer Hint" property for the label or control.

### Tips
- `localize-please` also works with plain text and markdown (.md) files. So you can automatically translate your release notes for an update by including a release-notes.md file in your project as a localized file
